## Title
feat: Add execution flow with hedge logic and clean terminal UI

## Description

This commit implements the complete execution flow with LP trade execution, hedge calculation, P&L tracking, and database logging. It also includes a complete UI overhaul for a cleaner operator experience.

### Features Added

#### 1. Execution Flow Implementation
- **Execution Manager** (`src/execution/execution_manager.py`)
  - Coordinates LP execution, hedge calculation, and P&L tracking
  - Integrates with existing hedge calculator and P&L calculator
  - Logs all executions to database with comprehensive tracking

- **Database Schema Updates** (`src/database/schema.py`)
  - Added `executions` table to track all trade executions
  - Stores execution status, hedge parameters, P&L results
  - Includes error logging for failed executions

- **LP Execution Interface** (`src/lps/sine_lp.py`)
  - Implemented `execute_trade()` method in SineLP
  - Simulates execution with realistic delays
  - Validates quote expiry before execution

#### 2. Clean Terminal Interface
- **Simplified Commands** - Replaced complex menu with:
  - `p` - Proceed with execution
  - `c` - Cancel and return to main menu
  - `q` - Quit application

- **Removed Debug Output**
  - Eliminated all `[DEBUG]` messages from quote_streamer
  - Clean quote display with only essential information
  - Shows updates only when quotes improve

- **Execution Flow**
  1. Enter quote request
  2. System displays locked quote
  3. Operator chooses action (p/c/q)
  4. Execution completes and shows results
  5. Returns to main menu automatically

#### 3. Monitor Enhancements
- **EXECUTED Status Display**
  - Monitor shows "EXECUTED" in green after successful trade
  - Status persists (doesn't get overwritten by timer)
  - Removed redundant status line at bottom
  - Added `is_executed` flag to prevent timer interference

- **Quote Box Status**
  - ⏱ Countdown (green) - Quote active
  - ❌ EXPIRED (red) - Quote timed out
  - ✅ EXECUTED (green) - Trade completed

#### 4. Database Viewer Utility
- **New `view_db.py` utility** for analyzing stored data:
  - `python view_db.py stats` - Summary statistics
  - `python view_db.py executions` - Recent executions
  - `python view_db.py performance` - LP performance metrics
  - `python view_db.py all` - Complete overview

- **Enhanced Statistics**
  - Total executions count
  - Success rate tracking
  - Total P&L in USDT

#### 5. LP Quote Logging
- **Already Fully Implemented** (verified working):
  - All aggregated quotes logged to `quotes` table
  - All LP responses logged to `lp_quotes` table
  - LP performance metrics tracked automatically

### Technical Details

#### Hedge Logic (8 Scenarios)
The system calculates hedge parameters based on:
- **target_asset** (base or quote)
- **side** (BUY or SELL)
- **profit_asset** (base or quote)

Example: BUY 1.5 BTC with profit_asset='quote'
- Client pays 150,075 USDT, receives 1.5 BTC
- System buys exactly 1.5 BTC for 150,000 USDT
- Profit: 75 USDT (kept in USDT)

#### Execution Flow
1. User presses 'p' to execute
2. Stream stops immediately
3. Trade executes with LP
4. Hedge calculated and simulated
5. P&L computed and displayed
6. Results logged to database
7. Monitor shows "EXECUTED" status
8. Returns to main menu

### Files Modified

**Core Logic:**
- `src/main.py` - Simplified UI, execution integration
- `src/core/quote_streamer.py` - Removed debug logs
- `src/ui/monitor.py` - EXECUTED status, removed status line
- `src/database/schema.py` - Added executions table

**New Files:**
- `src/execution/execution_manager.py` - Execution coordinator
- `view_db.py` - Database viewer utility
- `test_execution.py` - Execution flow test
- `EXECUTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed documentation
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Updated with execution commands

**Existing Files (Utilized):**
- `src/execution/hedge_calculator.py` - Already working
- `src/execution/pnl_calculator.py` - Already working
- `src/execution/simulator.py` - Already working
- `src/database/quote_logger.py` - Already working

### Testing
All execution scenarios tested and working:
- Quote locking and streaming
- Execution with p command
- Monitor EXECUTED display
- Database logging
- Return to main menu

### Documentation
- `EXECUTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete implementation guide
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Updated with new commands
- Code comments added throughout

### Breaking Changes
None - All changes are additive

### Migration Notes
Database will automatically create `executions` table on next run.
