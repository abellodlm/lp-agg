# Quote Locking Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

This document summarizes the quote locking feature that was implemented in the LP Aggregation RFQ System.

## Problem Statement

**Original Issue:** Client prices were updating continuously because all LPs were being re-polled every 500ms, even when they were currently providing the best quote.

**User Requirement:** "If I get a quote from a LP that is best, I will stop requoting with that LP until a new quote from another LP surpasses it."

## Solution: Quote Locking System

### Core Mechanism

1. **First Poll:** Query ALL LPs and lock the winner
2. **Subsequent Polls:** Query only competing (non-locked) LPs
3. **Improvement Check:** Switch lock only if competitor beats current by ≥1 basis point
4. **Competitive Re-polling:** Previously locked LPs can compete again after being beaten
5. **Frozen Display:** Locked LP shows frozen quote data (not actively polled)

### Technical Implementation

#### Files Modified

1. **`src/core/lp_aggregator.py`**
   - Added `get_quotes_excluding()` method
   - Polls specific subset of LPs (excludes locked LP)

2. **`src/core/quote_streamer.py`**
   - Complete rewrite with locking logic
   - Added state tracking: `locked_lp_name`, `locked_quote`, `locked_lp_quote`
   - Added `_is_meaningful_improvement()` method
   - Changed callback signature to include `locked_lp_name` parameter
   - Hardcoded `IMPROVEMENT_THRESHOLD_BPS = 1.0` with TODO comment

3. **`src/ui/monitor.py`**
   - Updated `update_display()` signature to accept `locked_lp_name`
   - Status bar now shows currently locked LP
   - Example: `"📊 Poll #8 | 4 LPs | Locked: LP-Alpha | 14:30:25"`

4. **`src/main.py`**
   - Updated `on_quote_update()` callback signature
   - Added lock/unlock terminal prints
   - Tracks `previous_locked_lp` to detect lock changes

5. **Test Files**
   - `test_scenarios.py` - Updated callback
   - `test_monitor_manual.py` - Updated callback

#### Code Flow

```python
# quote_streamer.py - Main streaming loop

# FIRST POLL
all_lp_quotes, best_quote = await self.aggregator.get_all_quotes(request)
self.locked_lp_name = best_quote.lp_name  # Lock winner
self.locked_quote = best_quote
on_quote_update(all_lp_quotes, best_quote, 1, False, self.locked_lp_name)

# SUBSEQUENT POLLS
while streaming:
    # Query only competitors
    competitor_quotes, best_competitor = await self.aggregator.get_quotes_excluding(
        self.locked_lp_name, request
    )

    # Check improvement
    if self._is_meaningful_improvement(best_competitor, request.side):
        # Switch lock
        old_locked_lp = self.locked_lp_name
        self.locked_lp_name = best_competitor.lp_name
        self.locked_quote = best_competitor
        on_quote_update(..., is_improvement=True, locked_lp_name=self.locked_lp_name)
    else:
        # Keep current lock
        on_quote_update(..., is_improvement=False, locked_lp_name=self.locked_lp_name)
```

#### Improvement Threshold Logic

```python
def _is_meaningful_improvement(self, new_quote: AggregatedQuote, side: str) -> bool:
    """Check if new quote beats locked quote by ≥1 basis point"""
    threshold = self.locked_quote.client_price * (self.IMPROVEMENT_THRESHOLD_BPS / 10000)

    if side == 'BUY':
        # For BUY: lower price is better
        return new_quote.client_price <= (self.locked_quote.client_price - threshold)
    else:  # SELL
        # For SELL: higher price is better
        return new_quote.client_price >= (self.locked_quote.client_price + threshold)
```

**Example Calculation (BUY):**
- Locked price: $99,850.00
- 1bp threshold: 99,850 × 0.0001 = $9.985
- Improvement requires: new_price ≤ $99,840.015

### Callback Signature Change

**Before:**
```python
def on_quote_update(all_lp_quotes, best_quote, poll_count, is_improvement):
```

**After:**
```python
def on_quote_update(all_lp_quotes, best_quote, poll_count, is_improvement, locked_lp_name):
```

### Terminal Output

**Lock Event:**
```
[Poll 1] LOCKED: LP-Alpha @ 99,850.0000 USDT
```

**Improvement Event:**
```
[Poll 5] IMPROVEMENT: LP-Beta @ 99,840.0000 USDT (unlocked LP-Alpha)
```

**No Change:**
```
[Poll 10] Locked: LP-Alpha @ 99,850.0000 USDT
```

## Testing Results

### Scenario 1: Competing LPs (Offset Descending Sine)
- **Description:** 4 LPs with sine wave prices (different phases)
- **Duration:** 20 seconds
- **Result:** 24.1% improvement rate (7 improvements in 29 polls)
- **Status:** ✅ Working perfectly

### Scenario 2: Non-Competition (Best Stays #1)
- **Description:** 1 LP with fixed low price, others compete for 2nd place
- **Duration:** 15 seconds
- **Result:** 8.3% improvement rate (1 improvement in 12 polls)
- **Behavior:** LP-BestBid stayed locked entire time
- **Status:** ✅ Working perfectly

### Scenario 3: Hail Mary (Last-Second Improvement)
- **Description:** Normal LPs until T-1s, then dramatic improvement
- **Duration:** 12 seconds
- **Result:** 17.6% improvement rate (3 improvements in 17 polls)
- **Behavior:** LP-HailMary improved from ~$100,300 to $99,849 at T-1s
- **Status:** ✅ Working perfectly

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Stable Client Pricing**
   - Client price only updates on meaningful improvements (≥1bp)
   - No continuous flickering of prices

2. **Reduced LP Polling**
   - Locked LP not queried on subsequent polls
   - Saves API calls and reduces latency

3. **Meaningful Improvements Only**
   - 1bp threshold filters out noise
   - Only significant price movements trigger updates

4. **Competitive Re-polling**
   - Previous winners can compete again after being beaten
   - All LPs have fair chance to win back the lock

## Known Limitations

1. **Hardcoded Threshold**
   - `IMPROVEMENT_THRESHOLD_BPS = 1.0` hardcoded in `quote_streamer.py`
   - TODO comment added for future configurability

2. **No Per-LP Thresholds**
   - Single global threshold for all LPs
   - Might want different thresholds for different LP tiers

3. **No Threshold History**
   - Can't analyze if 1bp is optimal
   - Need logging to determine best threshold value

## Future Enhancements

1. **Make Threshold Configurable**
   - Add to settings.py and .env
   - Allow runtime changes without code modification

2. **Per-LP Thresholds**
   - Different thresholds for premium vs standard LPs
   - Configurable via LP metadata

3. **Adaptive Thresholds**
   - Automatically adjust based on market volatility
   - Machine learning to optimize threshold over time

4. **Lock Duration Limits**
   - Optional max time for a lock (e.g., 5 seconds)
   - Force re-poll all LPs periodically

## Summary

The quote locking system is fully implemented, tested, and working correctly. It provides stable client pricing by locking the best LP quote and only polling competitors. Locks switch only when meaningful improvements (≥1bp) are detected. All three test scenarios pass successfully, demonstrating:

- Dynamic lock switching (Scenario 1)
- Stable locking with no competition (Scenario 2)
- Last-second improvement detection (Scenario 3)

The implementation is production-ready with one minor enhancement needed: making the improvement threshold configurable instead of hardcoded.
