# Execution Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented full execution flow with LP quote logging and hedge logic integration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **New `executions` table** ([schema.py:108-148](src/database/schema.py#L108-L148))
  - Tracks execution ID, quote ID, status, LP name
  - Records hedge parameters (exchange side, quantities)
  - Stores execution results (executed quantities, avg price, commission)
  - Captures P&L data (amount, asset, after fees, basis points)
  - Includes error messages for failed executions

### 2. Execution Manager ([execution_manager.py](src/execution/execution_manager.py))
- **Coordinates full execution flow**:
  1. Receives confirmed quote from operator
  2. Calculates hedge parameters using existing hedge calculator
  3. Executes with LP (client side trade)
  4. Simulates hedge execution (can be replaced with real exchange integration)
  5. Calculates P&L using existing P&L calculator
  6. Logs execution to database

- **Key Features**:
  - Returns comprehensive execution result dictionary
  - Handles execution failures gracefully
  - Logs both successful and failed executions
  - Integrates with existing QuoteLogger for database persistence

### 3. LP Execution Interface
- **Base LP class already had `execute_trade()` method** ([base_lp.py:34-45](src/lps/base_lp.py#L34-L45))
- **SineLP implementation** ([sine_lp.py:127-148](src/lps/sine_lp.py#L127-L148))
  - Simulates execution delay (0.2-0.5s)
  - Validates quote hasn't expired
  - Returns success/failure status

### 4. Clean Terminal Interface
- **Simplified command flow**:
  - Enter quote request (e.g., `b 1.5 btc btcusdt`)
  - System displays locked quote with key info
  - **Three commands during streaming**:
    - `p` - Proceed with execution
    - `c` - Cancel and return to main menu
    - `q` - Quit application

- **Removed debug output**:
  - No more `[DEBUG]` messages
  - Clean quote display showing only essential info
  - Only show updates when quote improves (better LP wins)

- **Quote Display Format**:
  ```
  ======================================================================
  QUOTE LOCKED
  ======================================================================

    LP:             LP-2
    Side:           BUY 1.5 BTC
    Client Pays:    150,075.00000000 USDT
    Client Gets:    1.50000000 BTC
    Price:          100,050.0000 USDT
    Valid for:      8.0s

  ======================================================================

  Commands: [p] proceed  [c] cancel  [q] quit
  ```

### 5. Execution Flow
1. **Quote Streaming**: Continuous polling with improvement detection
2. **User confirms with `p`**: Executes the locked quote
3. **Execution Result Display**:
   ```
   ======================================================================
   EXECUTION SUCCESSFUL
   ======================================================================

     Execution ID:   E20251022-120530-456
     Hedge:          BUY 1.50000000 BTC
     Avg Price:      100,000.00
     Net P&L:        74.92500000 USDT (4.99 bps)

   ======================================================================
   ```
4. **Automatic Return**: Stream stops, returns to main menu for new request

### 6. Database Viewer Updates ([view_db.py](view_db.py))
- **New `executions` command**: View recent executions
  - `python view_db.py executions [N]`
  - Shows execution ID, status, LP, hedge details, P&L

- **Updated stats**: Now includes:
  - Total executions count
  - Successful execution rate
  - Total P&L in USDT

- **Example**:
  ```bash
  python view_db.py executions 10   # Last 10 executions
  python view_db.py stats            # Summary stats
  python view_db.py all              # Everything
  ```

## Hedge Logic Explanation

The system uses **profit_asset** to determine hedge strategy (already implemented in [hedge_calculator.py](src/execution/hedge_calculator.py)):

### 8 Scenarios (2×2×2)
- **Target Asset**: base (BTC) or quote (USDT)
- **Side**: BUY or SELL
- **Profit Asset**: base or quote

### Example: BUY 1.5 BTC, profit_asset='quote' (USDT)
**Client Trade**:
- Client buys 1.5 BTC from you
- Client pays 150,075 USDT (at marked-up price)
- Client receives 1.5 BTC

**Your Hedge**:
- Buy **exactly 1.5 BTC** from LP at 100,000 USDT
- Spend 150,000 USDT
- **Profit = 75 USDT** (kept in USDT)

### Alternative: profit_asset='base' (BTC)
**Your Hedge**:
- **Spend ALL 150,075 USDT** client gave you
- Buy ~1.50075 BTC
- Give client 1.5 BTC
- **Profit = 0.00075 BTC** (kept in BTC)

## LP Quote Logging

**Already fully implemented!** ([quote_logger.py](src/database/quote_logger.py))
- Logs every aggregated quote to `quotes` table
- Logs all LP responses to `lp_quotes` table
- Tracks LP performance metrics (win rate, response time, best/worst prices)
- Automatically called by QuoteStreamer on every poll

## Testing

### Quick Test Script ([test_execution.py](test_execution.py))
```bash
python test_execution.py
```
- Creates test quote request
- Gets quotes from 3 LPs
- Executes trade with best LP
- Shows P&L and logs to database

### Manual Testing
```bash
# 1. Run application
python -m src.main

# 2. Enter quote request
> b 1.5 btc btcusdt

# 3. Wait for locked quote, then:
> p                    # Execute
# or
> c                    # Cancel

# 4. View database
python view_db.py executions
```
